The goal is to allow for a full page, already setup wrapper which easily allows you to breakout content or to allow background or content to expand the full width of the page.

## NOTE: This only works for direct descendants of `gd`

to use this, first download and add the file to your project.

use class `gd` on your `<main>` to use it for the whole page

use class `gd-breakout` to allow content to expand slightly

use class `gd-bg-full-width` to extend background the full width of the page (if you have a background colour you which to span the whole page, for example)

use class `gd-content-full-width` to allow the content to expand the full with of the page.
